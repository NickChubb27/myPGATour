# myPGATour

My PGA Tour is a client-side web app (written in HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript) golfers can use while playing 9 or 18 holes. It lets the user directly compete with top PGA Tour golfers like Tiger Woodds, Phil Mickelson & 59 other players.

The app learns how good you are based on how you are playing that day. It keeps you in the mix for the tournament, and allows you a chance at making a run to win the tournament near the end of your round.
